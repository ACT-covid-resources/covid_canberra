# covid_canberra

This repository is an extend of a small project to create a map contact locations in the ACT. A collection of R code for accessing and working with the public github projects avaliable for supporting community responses to covid-19 outbreaks. The overall output is inspired by the "Indiana COVID-19 Website" and the open source code they have published.

# Website template

This would not be possible without the open source community and code that is made avalaible.

## Indiana COVID-19 Website

This website tracks COVID-19 data statewide and by county. The Static Charts page shows COVID-19 positive tests and deaths, and various rates are calculated to track spread. Proxy metrics for estimating social distancing are also included along with data on hospital admissions and resources. The Demographics page has charts that show various case and death statistics calculated for each age group. The Hospitals page tracks additional data that might indicate strain on hospital resources. The COVIDcast dashboard follows a metric, combined indicator, that might be predictive of virus spread. Metropolitan Statistical Area statistics for cases and positivity rates are also provided.

> Please contact me if you find any issues with the site. My contact information and the code used to generate the site can be found on my github [page](https://github.com/ercbk). Data used to generate the charts can be downloaded through the R package, [indianacovid19data](https://ercbk.github.io/indianacovid19data/), [github](https://github.com/ercbk/indianacovid19data), or [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/4685381)  Website for [Indiana COVID-19 Tracker](https://github.com/ercbk/Indiana-COVID-19-Tracker)</br>

## rmarkdown-website-tutorial

[A tutorial for creating websites using R Markdown](https://jules32.github.io/rmarkdown-website-tutorial/).

To build the website, run [`rmarkdown::render_site()`](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html), which knits each Rmarkdown (*.Rmd) based on parameters in `_site.yml` before pushing the files back to Github. 

## shiny tutorial

To decide how to manage the interactive web apps that can be developed around the same reproducible reporting tool I have used a collection of shiny examples and tutorials. I have included this information to help other states do the same.
