# covid_canberra

This development branch converts the single Flexdashboard we have built and converts it into a website with multiple pages. This will allow additional flexdashboards to be added as well as other RMD documents with their associated features.

## github

The aim of this website is for the end product to be hosted on github pages, within the docs folder. This workflow takes advantage of the hosting of static webpages on github accounts.

## Shiny

The ability to extend the functionality of this site into a interactive shiny application can be found online in tutorials and within the Definitive Guide to RMarkdown. 

[This work is for future development currently but some functionality already exists if `runtime: shiny` is added to the RMD header.]
