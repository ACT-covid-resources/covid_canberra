There are also around 30 columns completely composed of missing values.

Indiana Data Hub: [website](https://hub.mph.in.gov/dataset?q=COVID)

#### Notes  
The missing values for `pos_rate` are partly because this dataset has a row for every day and the positivity rate is calculated every week. The other missing values are for Cincinnati, Louisville, and Evansville. At the time this dashboard was created, those states with counties included in those areas didn't publicly release the necessary data to calcuate the positivity rates for those areas.

Other variables:  
- `date`: yyyy-mm-dd format; date for daily `cases_100k`  
- `geo_value`: FIPS codes for `msa`  
- `start_date`: Start date of the weekly interval for `pos_rate`  
- `data_date`: Date when data was last updated

msa_hist <- read_csv("../Indiana-COVIDcast-Dashboard/data/msa-cases100-posrate-historic.csv")
